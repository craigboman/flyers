Todo List
=========

* change "Your Library Account" (everywhere) to match www.udayton.edu/libraries language: "My Library Account"

* add the QR code javascript to the bib_display.html page. (Maybe figure out 
a way to incorporate the "Text This To Me" button, or move the button)

* add find it / map it feature back for items in bib_display.html (basically 
anything that has a call number associated with it)

* stack the top buttons in "navigationRowRecord" so that they behave similar to 
the buttons in "icon_but_output" (i.e. they stack and expand all the way across
the page in mobile views) 

* create buttons for "logout" and "return to your record" links

* add icon for patron view (icon but_ret2prec)

* add icon for "Log Out" and  "Return To Your Record" anywhere they appear. 
Also, add log off button to the front page. --Sadly, there doesn't appear
to be a way to add a link to the "Return To Your Record" from the main pages.

* adjust the input boxes for the patron login page so they're more aligned / 
visually pleasing.

* fix the briefcit(x) page style so that the padding / separating lines are 
more visually pleasing.

* possibly add <!--{pager}--> token to the bottom of bib_display.html just before botlogo.html
 
* fix request problem (request icon shouldn't display) http://flyers.udayton.edu:2082/record=b1311694~S0

* fix javascript for the desktop and mobile view so that the navigation view changes when you switch viewports.
	(on mainmenu.html selected pages do not continue to stay selected when toggling viewports)

Finished / Addressed
